                                Halkidiki is a region in northern Greece that is known for its blue flag beaches, local food, and an extremely large resort in Sani Beach. 
                                The region is home to three peninsulas, each with its own unique character and attractions. 
                                One of which, is home to Mount Athos, a mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece, of which I will go into more detail below!
                                Some of the most popular beaches in the region include Sani Beach, Kallithea Beach, and Vourvourou Beach.

                                    My name is John Treon, I am a 2nd-generation Greek-American who has been visiting Greece since I was a child. I have a lot of family 
                                    in Greece, and I have been lucky enough to visit many of the beautiful places that Greece has to offer. I have been to the islands, the 
                                    mountains, the cities, and the countryside. I have eaten the food, swam in the sea, and danced at the festivals. Greece is a wonderful 
                                    country with the most welcoming people you will ever meet. I hope that my travel log will inspire you to visit Greece and experience a 
                                    little bit of my culture! <br><br> Pictured on the left, is myself, with my amazing hat, of which, my wife offered severe disdain to. 
                                    I thought it was cool. I hope you do too.

                                    My family comes from two main regions of Greece: Katerini, and Ioannina. My father is from Katerini, a small city in northern Greece, near Thessaloniki
                                    that is known for its city center, full of shops, cafes, and restaurants. The city is quaint, but that means you can walk everywhere! On 
                                    the other hand Ioannina, where my mother is from, is a rural area in northwestern Greece, near Albania. The area is known for its large lake, 
                                    and vibrant nightlife. It is home to many mountains, and is a great place to go hiking. I have been to both places many times, and I love them
                                    both. I hope you get to visit them too!
