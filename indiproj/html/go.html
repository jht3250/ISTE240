                            <span>
                                Lefkada is a beautiful island located in the Ionian Sea, off the western coast of Greece. 
                                The island is known for its stunning beaches, crystal-clear waters, and picturesque villages. 
                                Some of the most popular beaches on the island include Porto Katsiki, Egremni, and Kathisma. 
                                Lefkada is my personal favorite place to visit in Greece, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing and
                                beautiful vacation spot.
